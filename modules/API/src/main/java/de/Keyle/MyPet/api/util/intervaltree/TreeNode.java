/**
 * A representation of a single node in the {@link IntervalTree}.
 * <p>
 * Since the Interval Tree is practically a binary search tree, every node is
 * identified by a unique key - the center (called middlepoint) of the first
 * interval that triggers the creation of this node. The key is immutable and
 * can't be changed during the lifespan of this node. It can however move up or
 * down in the tree as a result of balancing rotations, similarly to a normal
 * balanced search tree. Unlike a traditional binary search tree, every node in
 * the interval tree can store multiple intervals. The invariant is, that each node
 * stores only intervals that contain its middlepoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are several invariants that the {@code TreeNode} needs to keep. First,
 * the subtrees rooted in each node are always kept balanced. Second, each node
 * must contain at least one interval, otherwise the node must be removed from
 * the tree to keep it as small as possible. Balancing is done by traditional
 * binary search tree rotations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Given an interval that needs to be found, inserted or removed from the tree,
 * an augmented binary search algorithm is performed in the following fashion.
 * For each visited node, check if the middlepoint of this node is contained in
 * the query interval. If so, then this node is the position where the query interval
 * must be stored. Otherwise, visit the left child, if the interval is entirely
 * to the left of the middlepoint, or visit the right child otherwise.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since intervals may contain middlepoints from multiple nodes in the tree,
 * there are multiple valid locations where an interval may be stored based
 * on the above augmented binary search algorithm. However, to ensure the
 * optimal time complexity of the {@link IntervalTree#add(Interval) add},
 * {@link IntervalTree#remove(Object) remove} and
 * {@link IntervalTree#contains(Object) contains} operations, we define the base
 * position of an interval (or base) as the node closest to root within the set of
 * nodes, where the interval may be stored. To be able to guarantee the
 * correctness of the algorithm, this invariant must be preserved after each
 * tree operation. This is especially important, when tree rotations are
 * performed. Whenever a node is promoted closer to the root as a result of a
 * rotation, the promoted node must assimilate all intervals from the node demoted
 * by the rotation. This ensures that whenever the binary search algorithm encounters
 * a node, which is a valid location for a given interval, this node will be the base
 * of the interval.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since each node can store multiple intervals, we need an efficient way
 * to perform intersecting queries (given a query in the form of a point or
 * an interval, find all intervals intersecting the query). The {@code TreeNode}
 * can't simply keep an ArrayList of all intervals stored in it, because
 * it will have to linearly check each interval in the List. This can
 * degrade the performance of the tree, especially in cases where a single
 * node contains all intervals. Intervals have to be stored in an ordered
 * way. Each node keeps its intervals in two {@link TreeSet}s at the same
 * time - one containing the intervals by their start points in ascending order
 * and the other by the end points in descending order. Whenever we have to provide
 * a set of all intervals contained within this node, that intersect a query point,
 * we check if the query is left or right of the middlepoint of the node.
 * If it is left, we iterate through the TreeSet ordered by the start points
 * until we reach an interval completely to the right of the query. Analogously,
 * if the query is to the right of the middlepoint, we iterate through the set
 * ordered by the end points until we reach an interval that's completely to
 * the left of the query. This allows us to only iterate through these intervals,
 * that we will actually return as a result of the query.
 * </p>
