Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from MyPet! Consider this a holiday gift - a new version of MyPet has released.

**MyPet 3.14.0 supports the following Minecraft versions**: 1.8.8, 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.3, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.1, 1.20.2, 1.20.3, 1.20.4, 1.20.5, 1.20.6, 1.21, 1.21.1, 1.21.2, 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.5, 1.21.6, 1.21.7, 1.21.8, 1.21.9, 1.21.10, 1.21.11

The MyPet 3.14 series will be the **last MyPet version series to support Minecraft 1.8.8, 1.12.2, 1.16.5, and 1.17.1**. MyPet 4.0 will not support these versions. Additional bugfixes may be released for 3.14 prior to MyPet 4.0’s release.

Additionally, the MyPet 3.14 series will be the **last MyPet version series to support base Spigot server software**. Paper is the superior and most widely used server software, with over 82% of Minecraft Java servers today running Paper or offshoots of Paper. Making the switch is as easy as swapping your server jar. Switch to Paper today: https://papermc.io

Currently, MyPet is primarily developed by one person - me! All of these updates are produced for free in my spare time. If you or your players appreciate MyPet, please consider buying me a coffee or lunch (it means a lot): https://ko-fi.com/UserDerezzed

**This update was also made possible by MaksyKun, haeherfader, and coleslydn, who each contributed their own time to this project. Thank you!**

Now, onto the changes!
## MyPet Skilltree Creator
[![MyPet Skilltree Creator Image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/de487855be21385e3494dc74e446556d8fb58cf0_0.webp)](https://skilltree.mypet-plugin.de)
The skilltree creator has been completely redesigned and is now available through the web. Visit it here: https://skilltree.mypet-plugin.de

You can also double-click on the plugin jar to have the skilltree creator open in your browser.
## New Minecraft versions and new Pets
Minecraft 1.21.11 is now supported. Additionally, you can now capture Copper Golems, Creakings, Baby Dolphins, Baby Glow Squids, and Baby Squids as Pets. Salmon Pets will now retain their correct size when captured and released, and Cat Pets will remain tamed and retain their correct fur pattern when captured and released. This also means you can now dye your Cat Pet’s collar!  Copper Golems have oxidation mechanics similar to vanilla Minecraft:
- Right-click with Axe → strip oxidation
- Right-click with Honeycomb → wax to prevent oxidation
  Unique to MyPet:
- Right-click with Poppy → place flower on head
- Right-click with Shears → remove poppy

Additionally, server owners can modify the Copper Golem Pet oxidation interval, or disable oxidation outright.

## Bleed Skill
Pets can now learn to make their opponents bleed! This Skill allows you to customize the amount of damage, the interval at which the opponent will bleed, how long the opponent will bleed for, and the chance that the opponent will bleed. Additionally, the bleeding opponent will drop blood particles every time it loses health. This Skill is already implemented into the MyPet Skilltree Creator and can be added to your existing skilltrees.

## Bugfixes
Pets have learned how to follow their owner more naturally. Additionally, airborne Pets no longer zoom off into the distance and despawn when their owner is going faster than default speed.

Notably, many server crashes have been fixed, including a common crash when Pets would teleport towards the player when far away from the origin point of the world. MyPet no longer prevents Multiverse from creating worlds on 1.21.8-1.21.10, and many edge case client and server crashes have been fixed.
