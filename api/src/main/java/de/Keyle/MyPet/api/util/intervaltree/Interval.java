/**
 * A representation of a generic interval. The interval can be open or closed (the start
 * and end points may be inclusive or exclusive), as well as bounded and unbounded (it can
 * extend to positive or negative infinity).
 * <p>
 * The class doesn't assume that the intervals are numeric, instead it is generalized to
 * represent a contiguous subset of elements, where contiguity is defined with respect to
 * an arbitrary total order function. These elements can be for example {@link java.util.Date}s
 * or basically any type, the elements of which can be compared to one another. Since the
 * class requires its generic variable to implement the {@link Comparable} interface, all
 * comparisons in the internals of the {@code Interval} class are done via the interface method.
 * <p>
 * When subclassing the {@code Interval} class, note that the start and end points of the
 * interval <strong>can</strong> be {@code null}. A {@code null} start point represents
 * the negative infinity and a {@code null} end point represents positive infinity. This
 * fact needs to be kept in mind in particular when overwriting methods with default
 * implementations in the {@code Interval} class, such as {@link #contains(Comparable)},
 * {@link #isLeftOf(Comparable)}, and in particular {@link #equals(Object)} and
 * {@link #hashCode()}.
 *
 * @param <T> The type that represents a single point from the domain of definition of the
 *            interval.
