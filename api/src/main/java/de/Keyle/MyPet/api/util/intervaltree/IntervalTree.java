/**
 * An implementation of a Centered Interval Tree for efficient search in a set of intervals. See
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The tree functions as a set, meaning that it will not store an interval more than
 * once. More formally, for any two distinct intervals x and y within the tree, it is
 * guaranteed that x.equals(y) will evaluate to false. If you try to add an interval to the tree,
 * which is already in it, the tree will reject it. See the documentation of
 * {@link #add(Interval) the add method} for more information. The tree will also <strong>not</strong> accept
 * {@code null} or empty intervals, meaning intervals whose {@link Interval#isEmpty()}
 * method evaluates to {@code true}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #iterator()} method of the tree returns a fail-fast iterator, which will
 * throw a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}, if the tree is modified in any form
 * during the iteration, other than by using the iterator's own {@code remove} method. However,
 * this is done in a best-effort manner, since it is generally hard to guarantee this behaviour
 * while using non-atomic and not synchronized methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The tree relies on the usage of a subclass of the {@link Interval} class to represent the
 * intervals. The majority of the interval methods are already implemented within the
 * {@code Interval} class and don't have to be implemented by the extending class. Comparisons
 * between the intervals are also pre-implemented in the {@code Interval} class and use the
 * start and endpoints to create a total order of all stored intervals. However, if the tree
 * needs to store intervals that have the same start and end points but represent different
 * logical entities, you need a subclass that overwrites the {@code equals}, {@code hashCode}
 * and {@code compareTo} methods. See the documentation of {@link Interval} for more information.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> The type for the start and end point of the interval
